Palaoro, AV (2019) Dataset and code for biomechanical and shape analyses of freshwater anomurans. GitHub repository. https://github.com/alexandrepalaoro/ForgingWeapons 


-----------------------
#### File summary:</br>

<b>Biomech-GMM-Analyses</b>: *R code*. Code that organizes the data in the .xlsx file, loads the TPS files and run all analyses contained in the paper</br>

<b>males-morpho-data.xlsx</b>: *dataset*. Dataset with all the data used in the analyses of the manuscript, except fofr the shape files.</br>

<b>male-aeglids.tps</b>: *shape file*. File containing the 17 landmarks (6 landmarks and 11 semi-landmarks) digitized on the claws. The 
order of the individuals in this file is the same that you will find in the dataset. For more information on the location of the landmarks and semi-landmarks. Please see Figure 1 in the paper.
