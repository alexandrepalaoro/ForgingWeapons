R codes for my analyses on claw biomechanics and shape.

Here, you will find the first analyses I made (which included sex). After several revisions, I removed the sex factor and performed different tests than you will find in most of these scripts.

The code that generated the paper that will hopefully be published someday can be found in the file "Biomech-GMM-Analyses.R"

Any questions, let me know.
Hope you enjoy it :D
