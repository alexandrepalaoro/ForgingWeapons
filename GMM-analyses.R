## First, let's use the procD.lm() function to get eh full ANOVA table with
## F-values for all our variables. 

model1<-procD.lm(coords~Csize*species*sex,data=agdt,
                 RRPP=T,iter=999,logsz=T)
summary(model1)

## Now, for pairwise comparisons it is a bit more complicated. This analysis tests one model (f1)
## against another more complex model (f2), and does the pairwise comparisons based on that analysis.
## Thus, you have to be very careful on what you add in both models to make sure you are interpreting
## correctly. For more info on this: 
# https://github.com/geomorphR/geomorph/wiki/advanced.procD.lm-for-pairwise-tests-and-model-comparisons #

## In my case, I want to test if sexes and species are investing differently in shape. This means that I am
## interested in the interactions of the factors with the size co-variable (i.e. size * species and 
## size * sex). My first model is thus a model without slopes (i.e. size is not interacting with the factors)
## and my second model is the full model. Although it is not a significant triple interaction (as shown in
## the procD.lm analysis above), it is what I want to test. Morever, I chose to analyse the angles in degrees
## simply because they seem more straightforward to me.

# TESTING SHAPE VARIABILITY #
#############################

## Here, we will use morphological disparity to test which sex and species has the most
## variable shape. Again, this requires a bit of prior reading to understand what you are 
## really testing. The function morphol.disparity() calculates Procrustes variance based on
## a linear fit, which then procedes onto doing the pairwise comparisons. Therefore, if you
## are interested in analyzing the difference between species, the species factor should not
## go in the formula of the analysis, but rather in the groups= argument. If you add species 
## in the formula you are actually accounting for the difference in species and then testing
## if they are different. 
## In my case, my linear fit is accounting for a common allometric slope, and then doing the
## pairwise comparisons between species and sex. That way, I am ensuring that all the variance 
## left is related to species and sex prior to testing.

mdispar<-morphol.disparity(coords~log(Csize),groups=~species*sex,data=agdt)
mdispar


## The trajectory analysis is simpler. What you are testing needs to go into the formula.
## However, it does not accept continuous co-variables. Therefore, I am running one analysis
## without correcting for size and another one with the size-corrected variables (similar to)
## what I have done in the PCA analyses.
## In this analysis, we are testing how much shape is varying and in which direction. 
## The magnitude of shape change is the length of the line in the plot, and the direction 
## is the angle of the line. For more information, read: 
## Collyer and Adams (2015) - Phenotypic trajectory analysis: comparison of shape change 
## patterns in evolution and ecology. Hystrix, 24: 75-83.

# First, the size uncorrected analysis

traject<-trajectory.analysis(coords~species*sex,data=agdt)
summary(traject)
plot(traject)


# Now, the size corrected analysis

traject2<-trajectory.analysis(shape.resid~species*sex,data=agdt)
summary(traject2)
plot(traject2)

## For publication figures, Michael Collyer suggested messing around their plot function 
## manually, which is what I did. I am not going to post that code, but if someone wants
## more info, just send me and e-mail.
